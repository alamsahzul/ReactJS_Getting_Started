# ReactJS_Getting_Started
This will explain the very basic of ReactJS. hope this can blow your mind and help you to play around with React JS

Hint:
we have two main files that will be explained here to start, those are :

- index.js ==> the place to code what will we do.
- index.html ==> to display the rendering result from index.js file.
